# VehicleAccessControl
Java project for an assignment at the University of Stirling.
With a simple GUI, we can simulate the university barrier access control that allows only permit holders with different sets of conditions to enter the university campus with their vehicles.

The code was developed and submitted in March 2021 during the third year of my Computing Science degree.

## What does the application look like?

## Features

Time UI --> Simulate the passing of time

Administration --> Add new permit; issue a warning for a permit holder given the vehicle plate; delete a warning; cancel a permit; check status of a permit holder; modify a permit variables.

Barrier --> Shows whether a vehicle is allowed to pass by checking its registration number in the database.
